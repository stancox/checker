# Checker [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/netguru/checker.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/netguru/checker)

A collection of modules for which every is designed to check syntax in files to be commited via git.

## Usage

### Install
Checker is available in rubygems, so you just need to do:
```
gem install checker
```
If you are using bundler, you can add it to your project via `Gemfile` file (best to put it under `:development` group).
Since checker is a command-line utility, there is no need to load it up in the application:
```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'checker', :required => false
end
```

After installing the gem please follow [Git hook](#git-hook) section for further details.

### Git hook

All you need to do is type in `checker install` and it will automatically install the prepare-commit-msg hook
to your current git project. It will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
checker

if [ $? == 1 ]; then
  exit 1
fi

text=`echo -n ':checkered_flag: '; cat $1`
echo $text > $1
```

If you don't want your commits be prepended by checkered flag you can remove two last lines from the prepare-commit-msg hook.

Now checker will halt the commit if it finds problem with source code. Couple examples:

#### pry
```
[ PRY - 1 files ]
  Checking app/models/user.rb... [FAIL]
46:binding.pry
```

#### conflict
```
[ CONFLICT - 1 files ]
  Checking a.bad.scss... [FAIL]
4:<<<<<<< Updated upstream
30:>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

#### sass
```
[ SASS - 1 files ]
  Checking a.bad.scss... [FAIL]
Syntax error: Invalid CSS after "qwe:": expected pseudoclass or pseudoelement, was "asd:"
        on line 1 of .checker-cache/3cc74408b797b92e79207a64d97ae429
  Use --trace for backtrace.
```

### Advanced usage

To check only specific filetypes on commit, use `git config` :

``` bash
git config checker.check 'ruby, haml, coffeescript'
```

### Available options

#### ruby
Checks for correct syntax in ruby (.rb) files

#### haml
Checks for correct syntax in haml files

#### pry

#### coffeescript

#### sass

#### slim

#### conflict
